Welcome to Jungle Chess 🌿♟️

Jungle Chess is a chaotic, high-power variant of standard chess. While the board and setup remain the same, every piece has been evolved with destructive new abilities. The goal remains to Checkmate the King, but the path to victory involves explosions, evaporation, and multi-piece captures.

🎯 Objective

Checkmate the opponent's King.

Just like standard chess, you must put the opponent in a position where they will lose on the next turn.

Note: "Evaporating" or "Exploding" the King is not the win condition; the King must be trapped in Checkmate.

🧩 Piece Changes
♛ The Queen (The Bomber)

Movement: Standard (any direction, any number of squares).

Explosive Capture:

When the Queen captures an enemy piece, she explodes.

The explosion removes all enemy pieces in the 8 squares surrounding the capture square.

The Queen is removed from the game in the explosion.

Note: The Queen does not explode if she is captured by an opponent; only when she performs the capture.

♜ The Rook (The Piercer)

Movement: Standard (horizontal or vertical).

Piercing Capture:

The Rook can "smash through" enemy pieces.

It can capture any amount of pieces in a row or column in a single turn.

It can stop on any square after capturing, or continue through.

It is only stopped by friendly pieces.

♝ The Bishop (The Zig-Zag)

Standard Movement: Slides diagonally like a standard bishop.

Zig-Zag Movement: The Bishop can move in a "staircase" pattern. It cannot jump over pieces, but can stop and capture if it hits an enemy.

Forward/Backward Zig-Zag: 1 square diagonally Forward-Right, then 1 square diagonally Forward-Left (repeating). Works in reverse as well.

Sideways Zig-Zag: 1 square diagonally Forward-Right, then 1 square diagonally Backward-Right (repeating). Works to the left as well.

♞ The Knight (The Evaporator)

Movement: Standard L-shape.

Passive Evaporation:

At all times, the Knight "evaporates" (removes) any enemy pieces sitting on the squares the Knight could move to.

This is a passive area-of-effect ability.

Knight-vs-Knight Interaction:

If two opposing Knights try to evaporate each other, both Knights are removed.

Crucial: Any other pieces affected by their evaporation zones are removed first before the Knights disappear.

♟️ The Pawn

Movement: Forward one square (or two squares on the first move).

Capture: Pawns capture forward or sideways (orthogonally). They cannot capture diagonally.

Promotion: Pawns must promote to a Queen upon reaching the last rank.

En Passant: Disabled.

♚ The King

Movement: Can move two squares in any direction (instead of one).

Castling: Disabled.

Vulnerability: The King is still subject to Check and Checkmate.
